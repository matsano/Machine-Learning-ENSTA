# Machine-Learning-ENSTA
Machine Learning Course (MI201) Project

## üìã Description
The goal of the project is to implement a learning approach capable to identify the toppings of a pizza, using real and synthetic data. The synthetic data is composed by pizza drawings, while the real one is real pizzas.
The data can be downloaded from the [page](http://pizzagan.csail.mit.edu/).

In this case, the problem is a multi-label prediction: each image may be characterized by several labels. Therefore, to solve this problem we worked on raw data and build the label predictor directly.

We did a fine tuning of a pre-learned neural network (ResNet), in other words, use the weights of a trained neural network to initialize a new model trained on data from the same images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software used

This project was implemented in Python.
